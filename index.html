            <p>The main objective is the fight against racism through financial assistance, but it is also to raise the standards of the products offered by the CA'store, the future will impose to the companies constraints due to the challenges of the current world whether they are environmental, social… According to our information, the CA'store products are not fully in line with these issues. Our product would pave the way for social changes by becoming the the first of a line and would potentially influence future products, especially since Kedge BS is a renowned school in terms of ecology and social. The second objective is therefore to promote sustainable products within the shop. Finally, the last objective is to create a product that can be assimilated to the school.

Development of the school’s clothing brand image

            <h2 class="display-4">We defend social injustice and racisme</h2>
            <p>-Expected results 

Our project fits perfectly into the current economic, political and social context. It will respond to several emergencies of this time: helping to reduce social and especially racial inequalities between populations but also maintenance and better respect for the environment.  
We will therefore bring progress at the social level, but we will also obtain an awareness of the young students of Kedge on the social dimension, representing the generation of tomorrow, on sensitive subjects such as the fight against injustices and inequalities. 

Finally, we expect our product to become an integral part of Kedge’s identity as a result; as a brand associated with Ca'store we put forward the strong entrepreneurial aspect of our establishment.
